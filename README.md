# Typescript html boilerplate

This is a boilerplate code to play around with typescript, html and webpack. Use it as a base for your solutions.

## How to start

Install the latest node (8.1.2). It should work with other versions too, but I have not checked.

```bash
$ npm install -g yarn
$ cd {project folder, the one with package.json}
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

It should start dev server on `http://localhost:8080`.  
There you should see something like this:

## How to build

```bash
$ yarn build
```
The bundle is located in `./dist/` directory.
